<!-- Content Stylesheet for Site -->
<!--
	Java cannot currently handle HTML tags of the form <xxx />, e.g. <br/>;
	the trailing > characters are output to the display, which messes it up.
	Java does handle <br></br> OK, but as the output from this stylesheet
	does not have to be XHTML, for simplicity the trailing slashes have been removed.

	The extended LDAP sampler was built to support testing for very complex testpurposes.
	It was aimed at supporting the LDAP operations as close as possible.
	As the results are not passed back in a user-readable form, I invented my own xml definition to 
	construct an answer in xml encoding, so the results may be parsed with regextracter or alike functions.
